# 2D Waves Simulation with the Conjugate Gradient Method

This simulation is implemented by numerically solving the linear wave equation with implicit finite differences, where the subsequent linear system of equations is solved using the [conjugate gradient method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method). All computation including the conjugate gradient algorithm is done in the GPU through GLSL shaders.
