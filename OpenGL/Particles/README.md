# Gravity Particles Simulation

Simulation of particles interacting through a universally attractive Coulomb potential.
This is done using a brute force approach, where the interaction of each particle to every other particle is accounted for. The reference for this simulation is [Chapter 31 of GPU Gems 3](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-v-physics-simulation/chapter-31-fast-n-body-simulation-cuda) by Lars Nyland, Mark Harris, and Jan Prins. Another helpful resource is [this blog post](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/06/29/) by Chris Wellons, particularly in how to handle the movement and display of particles without having to move data to the CPU.
