# Waves

Source files used to create a waves program in 2D. At the moment only Swift and Metal shader files are included, so the only way to run this is to start a new XCode Storyboards project and then overwrite the generated files with the files found here. Next you must go to the Main file tab and find and set `View` to `GView`.
